This repository contains R pipelines to (1) design a _de novo_ sgRNA library and (2) evaluate all potential binding sites of a given sgRNA library on any NCBI genome. Additionally, it contains an example of possible downstream expected efficiency analyses for the latter. Lastly, it contains a subdirectory with the code to generate the na√Øve power analysis as published in \<submitted\>.

# Core function
For both types of analyses mentioned above, it is necessary to identify and score sgRNA binding sites. That is what the function `sgRNAefficiencyMC()` in the file **function_sgRNAefficiencyMC.R** does. It uses the [`CRISPRseek` package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CRISPRseek.html) and supports multicore processing with the `parallel` package. In principle the user never has to open or adapt the script containing this function.  

This function is called by both the sgRNA design and the sgRNA evaluation scripts. 

## Input
Argument | Description
--- | ---
`sgRNAs` | DNAStringSet object containing a set of sgRNAs, passed to `gRNAs` in `CRISPRseek::searchHits()`.
`genes` | data.frame object containing gene information extracted from GFF file with columns seqid, source, type, start, end, score, strand, phase and attribute.
`genome` | DNAStringSet object containing the set of chromosomes of the genome of interest. Can contain plasmids too. Each DNAString in the set is passed to `seqs` argument of `CRISPRseek::searchHits()`.
`reprAct` | logical. Should the expected relative retained repression activity of the sgRNAs for each of their binding sites be computed? See `penalties` for details on score calculation. Default: `TRUE`.
`dist2SC` | logical. If a binding site falls (partially) within the range of an annotated feature (see `name_by`) on the genome, should the relative distance of that binding site to the start codon of that feature be computed? Default: `TRUE`.
`name_by` | character. Indicates the feature tag in `attributes` variable of `genes` to label the features by. Default: `"locus_tag"`.
`penalties` | character. One of `"qi.mean.per.region"`, `"qi"` or `"custom"`. Indicates the scoring system to quantify `reprAct`, if set to `TRUE`. `"qi"` uses the per-base mismatch penalties as estimated from Qi _et al._ (2013), Figure 5D ("Repression activity (relative)"). `"qi.mean.per.region"` uses the same penalties, averaged over the three regions indicated in that same Figure. Choose `"custom"` to define custom penalties. For every sgRNA - binding site combination, the `reprAct` score is defined as the product of the penalties for its mismatched bases. Here, we assume the observation of independence of mismatches (Qi _et al._, 2013) can be extended to >2 and non-adjacent mismatches. Default: `"qi.mean.per.region"`. 
`custom.penalties` | numeric vector of length 20, or `NULL`. If `penalties` is set to `"custom"`, indicates base pair-specific custom mismatch penalty scores ordered from from PAM-distal to PAM-proximal. Default: `NULL`.
`outfile` | character. Path to directory to store temporary results files. Default: current working directory (`getwd()`). 
`no_cores` | integer. Indicates the maximum number of logical processors to use for multicore (parallel) processing. When set to `1`, multicore processing is disabled. Parallel processing is highly recommended due to otherwise long computation times. The number of available logical processors can be found with `parallel::detectCores()`. It is advised to use `parallel::detectCores() - 2`. Default: `1`.
`...` | other arguments to be passed to `CRISPRseek::searchHits()`.

## Output
The function returns an R data.frame object in which every row is one unique binding site - sgRNA combination, with the following variables:  
Variable | Description
--- | ---
IsMismatch.pos1-20 | integer, 0 or 1. Indicates whether (1) or not (0) the base at this position in the spacer was mismatched with the binding site. 
strand | character, + or -. Indicates the strand on which strand of the chromosome the binding site is located. 
chrom | character. Indicates the chromosome on which the binding site is located. Relevant in case of plasmids in the genome. 
chromStart | numeric. First base pair of binding site, counting from the chromosome start.
chromEnd | numeric. Last base pair of binding site, counting from the chromosome start.
name | character. Name of sgRNA that binds at binding site; unique identifier. 
gRNAPlusPAM | character. Sequence of the sgRNA that binds at the site, including PAM.
targetSequence | character. Sequence of the binding site, including PAM.
n.mismatch | numeric. Total number of mismatched base pairs between the sgRNA spacer and the binding site.
site | numeric. Unique binding site identifier. One binding site overlapping e.g. two annotated features will appear as two rows in the table, with a shared site ID.
NTgene | character. If the binding site lies (partially) within an annotated feature, indicates that feature name. Otherwise `NA`.
coverPart | character. If the binding site overlaps (partially) with an annotated feature, indicates which part of the spacer does so: complete overlap, with 3' or 5' end of the spacer. Otherwise: `NA`. 
coverSize | numeric. Number of overlapping base pairs between spacer and `NTgene`, if any.
reprAct | numeric, on the \[0,1\] interval. Estimated relative retained repression activity, compared to an hypothetical zero-mismatch binding site for the sgRNA at the same distance from the transcription start site.
dist2SC | numeric, on the \[0,1\] interval. Relative distance of the binding site to the start codon of `NTgene`, if any. Here, 0 means the binding site is located on the start codon or has partial overlap with the 5'-end of the feature and 1 means the binding site is on the far end of the feature or has partial overlap with its 3'-end.

Except the last six, this output comes from calling `CRISPRseek::searchHits()`. 


# _de novo_ sgRNA design
The pipeline in the file **sgRNA_library_design.R** can be run to design an sgRNA library for the given genome and annotated features of choice. It identifies all possible candidate sgRNAs targeting the non-template strands of all features. Then it calls the core function `sgRNAefficiencyMC()` to identify for each of the candidate sgRNAs all possible binding sites on the genome. Using that data, the maximum off-target `reprAct` score is computed for each sgRNA, per feature. Finally, the pipeline first selects for each feature the candidate sgRNAs with the lowest expected maximum off-target repression activity (within some user-defined error range) and secondly, of that subset, the one sgRNA with the smallest `dist2CS`. In addition, corresponding forward and reverse oligo's are designed for each selected sgRNA for library construction.  

Candidate sgRNAs for every feature are found using `CRISPRseek::findgRNAs()` and genomes and annotations (GFF files) are imported from NCBI using the [biomartr package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=biomartr). The pipeline supports multicore processing.

## Usage
Open the script (we recommend in the RStudio integrated development environment), adjust the input parameters in the first code section `#### 1. Settings ####` and then run the whole script with those input parameters. Depending on the genome size, number of annotated features, number of allowed mismatches in binding site identification, number of cores used for parallel processing and computer specifications, computation times may be in the order of one to a few hours. Regarding the Python3 script TINDERi.py, as it is initialized from the command window, its highly advisable to download and install anaconda. This should ensure a proper working Python environment. All required dependencies can be seen at the top of the Python script as `import`. 

## Input

`PAM` | character. Proto-spacer Adjacent Motif sequence. Default: `"NGG"`.
`output_target_fasta` | logical. Whether to output a .fasta file containing all sequences for which sgRNAs are designed. Default: `TRUE`.
`output_full_list` | logical. Whether to output a .csv file containing all found binding sites for all found candidate sgRNAs. Default: `TRUE`.
`output_optimized_list` | logical. Whether to compute and output a list of one optimal sgRNA per feature in .csv format. Default: `TRUE`.

## Output
The pipeline can return three files, depending on user input parameters:

Includes an extra column `maxOffreprAct`, indicating the maximum off-target `reprAct` score found for that sgRNA - binding site combination. Also includes four extra columns containing forward (`forward`) and reverse (`reverse`) sgRNA base-pairing strands for sgRNA library construction, and forward (`oligoForward`) and reverse (`oligoReverse`) oligo's to be ordered to construct the annealed sgRNA library pool.
